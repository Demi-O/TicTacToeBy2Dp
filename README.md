# TicTacToeBy2Dp
Tic tac toe game with Samuel Peters, with help from Fikayo Odunayo.

This was my first android application, it was a little complex so I had to ask my friend Fikayo Odunayo for some help with the coding, how I should structure the program and some help with the AI logic.
My other friend Samuel Peters handled all the images.

This application was made with the eclipse IDE.

Available on the google play store.
